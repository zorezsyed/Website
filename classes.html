<h1>My Classes</h1>
<p>I am offering virtual Zoom coding classes because I am passionate about the importance of new technologies and how it can help improve people's lives. Plus, it's just fun to figure out how to make the code work.</p> 
<p>Check out some classes below and <a href="https://zorez.ziasyed.com/signup.html" target="_blank"><b>Sign Up Here</b></a>.</p>

<p>Once the students are familiar with Scratch and the CS First curriculum, they can complete <a href="https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/curriculum.html" target="_blank">other hands-on activities</a> in their own time.</p>
<br>
<h2>What to expect!</h2> 
<p>Once you have signed up, I will email you the Zoom invite at least a day before the class begins.</p>
<dl>
    <p>This is an introduction to the programming language of Scratch. <a href="https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/code-your-hero/overview.html" target="_blank">"Code Your Hero"</a> will concentrate on how a character can be programmed to move and how to add sounds through coding.</p> 
    <p>Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories, games and animations.</p>

    <p>You will learn basic programming concepts such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat loops</li>
        <li>Forever loops</li>
        <li>If/then statements</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will cover three topics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Move your hero up and down when arrow keys are pressed</li>
        <li>Make your hero fly over buildings</li>
        <li>Add sound to your project</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How we will spend our time</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SAZrJEYQMkjCiNvW-e6ZLXEP9IJWInC6Ry8Bv3071hI" target="_blank">presentation deck</a> that I will be using for the "Code Your Hero" session.</li>
        <li>Majority of the session will be hands-on programming demos and helping students as they program their own apps.</li>
    </ul> 
</dl>
<br>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
Please ask your parents to help you:
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPWEmq8PRxqJwExhPp63WtvpMLRkLGp1/view" target="_blank">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Setup a split screen</b></a> either using a monitor or two browser windows next to each other:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>One window where you can see my Zoom presentation</li>
            <li>One browser window where you can navigate to <a href="http://g.co/csfirst" target="_blank"><b>g.co/csfirst</b></a>.</li>
        </ul> 
        <li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tGGIV5N9bA3cmYQfSC1Fsj6MmfAv9Gwy/view" target="_blank"><b>Sign-in to CS First as "Student"</b></a> using the class code "<b style="color:red">skxwhf</b>" and create your student account.</p></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Why I teach coding!</h2>
<p>Computers are everywhere and technology is becoming very important. Unfortunately, only 47% of all high schools teach computer science today. </p>
<p>The good news is, we're on our way to change this! If you've heard about the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> before, you might know it made history - more than 100 million students around the world have tried an Hour of Code. Even leaders like President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote their first lines of code as part of the campaign.</p>
<p>To help, I offer free virtual Zoom programming lessons to other students with the hope that they'll become familiar with technology in their early years and may also decide to help teach others in the world.</p>
<p>The students will create their own apps or games that they can show their parents afterwards, and we'll also print an <a href="https://code.org/certificates" target="_blank">Hour of Code certificate</a> for them to keep. And, it's fun! With interactive, hands-on activities, students will learn computational thinking skills in an enjoyable way.</p>
<p>While the class content is targeted towards elementary school age (1st-5th grade), the whole family is welcome to join.</p>
